# Facial Emotion Detection

 - This Project contains Machine learning Model Trined To Detect Human facial emotion Detection There are two codes for model Model 1 and 2 are basicaly the same      but the only difference is that model 1 is trainde without any colors while model 2 is for colored image 
 - The trained model and code for model 1 is Present in the Repo while the model 2 only has the code 
 - I have use harcascade Classifier to detect My Face through camera But for better accuracy dlib can be used
 - Test file is the code to run the model and detect the emotions through Camera of laptop or PC
